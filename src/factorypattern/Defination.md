you use the Factory design pattern when you want to define the class of an object at runtime. It also allows you to encapsulate object creation so that you can keep all object creation code in one place.

#Definition 2:

Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client program to the factory class.

#Definition 3

Define an interface for creating an object, but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses
