Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing.

Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype design pattern uses java cloning to copy the object.
