# Decorator Design Pattern

* Decorator design pattern allows to add new functionality an existing object without altering its structure. 
* This pattern created a decorator class which wraps the origin class and provide additional functionality keeping class method signature interact.
* To extends or modify the behavior of 'an instance' at runtime, decorator pattern is used.
* In Object oriented programming the decorator design pattern allows behavior to be added to an individual object, either statically or dynamically 
  without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.
* You want to add behavior or state to objects at runtime, Inheritance is not feasible because it is static and applies to an entire class.
* Extending an object's functionality can be done statically using inheritance however it might be necessary to extend an object functionality 
  dynamically as an object is used. 
* The decorator pattern  applies when there is a need to dynamically add as well as remove responsibilities to a class, and when subclass would 
  be impossible due to large number of subclasses that could result.
